Blanko - a fairly blank WordPress Theme
=======================================

This is a boilerplate for headless WordPress development, features:

* Internal javascripts
* External javascript loaded via functions.php

The idea is to get content via the REST API rather than PHP.

## How to install this theme

Download the zip, and install the theme via the Dashboard.
